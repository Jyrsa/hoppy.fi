hoppy - humalahakuisesti.fi
=========================

hoppy is a hobby project of mine written to solve the problem of which beers
to buy on a trip to Alko.

It started off as something fun I thought of when the Finnish alcohol monopoly
company put their drink availability online in a relatively simple format. Add
to that the fact that the the buyers at Alko seem to have sprained their taste
buds and sometimes arbitary placement of new products it can sometimes be a
challenge to know what is available and what offers good bang for the buck.


Testing
----------

run tests with
    
    python manage.py test --settings=hoppy.test_settings

as e.g. Huey needs to know not to actually delay execution etc.
