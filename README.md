=========================

hoppy is a hobby project of mine written to solve the problem of which beers
to buy on a trip to Alko.

It started off as something fun I thought of when the Finnish alcohol monopoly
company put their drink availability online in a relatively simple format. Add
to that the fact that the the buyers at Alko seem to have sprained their taste
buds and sometimes arbitary placement of new products it can sometimes be a
challenge to know what is available and what offers good bang for the buck.

The project is currently very much a work in progress.

ToDo:

1. Create a minimal schema and a db fixture to try out the ideas
2. Create tools to scrape stuff from Alko, Ratebeer and others
3. Set up Huey and Redis for simple delayed tasks and cron-like tasks 
4. Figure out front-end
