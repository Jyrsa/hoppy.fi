alko_stores.csv
---------------
 Contains lat long pairs and Alko names + name of community (kunta/kaupunki)
 in which an Alko is.

 The import function is cowardly and uses the name of the Alko to find address
 etc. If Alko name is unambiguous (as often is) the info needs to be entered
 manually. Hence there is also a fixture of the alko locations.

 The CSV is here for purposes of reconstructing and/or for future updates to
 the csv.
